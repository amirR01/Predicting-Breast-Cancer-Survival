# Predicting breast cancer survival using machine learning models

In this project, we aim to predict the survival of breast cancer patients using machine learning models. We will use clinical data, gene expression data, and gene mutation data to predict the survival of breast cancer patients. We will use deep learning models and traditional machine learning models to predict the survival of breast cancer patients. We will compare the performance of different machine learning models in predicting the survival of breast cancer patients.

We also use different algorithms like PCA, MDS, and t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize the data in 2D and 3D space.
